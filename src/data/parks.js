    personalNotes: "The cave tour was incredible—some passages felt endless! The forest trails and river added a nice contrast to the underground world. Once you get to the park's headquarters, you can book a cave tour. Despite my dislike for crowds, the cave tour was just short enough to not be annoying. The park is also a great place to see bats, especially in the evening."
