    description: "Mammoth Cave National Park, located in Kentucky, is home to the world's longest cave system, stretching over 400 miles. Visitors can explore vast underground chambers, stunning rock formations, and winding passageways, while above ground, the park offers lush forests, scenic trails, and the Green River for wildlife spotting.",

    bestTimeToVisit: "Spring and fall",
    personalNotes: "The cave tour was incredibleâ€”some passages felt endless! The forest trails and river added a nice contrast to the underground world. Once you get to the park's headquarters, you can book a cave tour. Despite my dislike for crowds, the cave tour was just short enough to not be annoying. The park is also a great place to see bats, especially in the evening."
