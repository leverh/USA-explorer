I felt that the tour (with a NP guide) was a little overly 'spiritual' for an atheist. I would have preferred a more factual account of the history and culture of the Ancestral Puebloans. However, the dwellings themselves are very impressive and worth seeing. The views from the top of the cliffs are also breathtaking. Overall, a must-see if you're in Colorado and interested in history."
